# 2017 Vision
[Robot Code](https://github.com/frc1418/2017-robot) | [Dashboard](https://github.com/frc1418/2017-dashboard) | **Vision**

This code was written for our Raspberry Pi coprocessor's vision processing.

We planned to use it during the 2017 competition, however we eventually elected to run vision processing directly on the RoboRIO instead, and development was merged into [2017-robot](https://github.com/frc1418/2017-robot). This repository has been preserved to keep development history intact, not to share finished code. Published Vision source for 2017 may be found in [2017-robot/robot/camera](https://github.com/frc1418/2017-robot/tree/master/robot/camera).
